abstract: >-
  CSV is a popular format for storing tabular data
  used in many disciplines. Metadata concerning the
  contents of the file is often included in the
  header, but it rarely follows a format that is
  machine readable - sometimes is not even human
  readable! In some cases, such information is
  provided in a separate file, which is not ideal as
  it is easy for data and metadata to get separated.


  CSVY is a small Python package to handle CSV files
  in which the metadata in the header is formatted in
  YAML. It supports reading/writing tabular data
  contained in numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames and
  nested lists, as well as metadata using a standard
  python dictionary.
